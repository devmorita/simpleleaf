# Simple script for Leafee (not official)

This is the simple program to communicate with a "Leafee" that is the magnetic open-closed door sensor (BLE).

----

## Get Started

### 1. Requirements

* `H/W : At least one leafee device`
* `S/W : Python2.7`
* `S/W : bluepy version 1.2.0`
```
 # apt-get install python-pip libglib2.0-dev
 # pip install bluepy==1.2.0
```

### 2. Optional

* `M/W : sqlite3`
  This software can log into sqlite database file.
  It automatically creates the database in /tmp/sqlite/sensor.db,
```
# apt-get install sqlite3
```

### 2. Before Starting

 Investigate the leafee device MAC address.
 Here is the example how to find it by bluz by Raspberry Pi 2/3/ZeroW/ZeroWH
 leafee is shown as MA
```
 # apt-get install bluez
 # bluetoothctl
   [bluetooth]# scan on 
      [NEW] Device xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx MA
   [bluetooth]# scan off 
   [bluetooth]# scan on
   [bluetooth]# quit
```

### 3. Run
Here is the usage.
```
USAGE   : python simpleleaf.py {leafee device address} {device no} {options: print / debug / save / sqlite}
EXAMPLE : python simpleleaf.py "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" 1 print save sqlite
```
* `device no     : any number to identify the log.`
* `print option  : standard output, set to use.`
* `debug option  : same as print option.`
* `save  option  : save the log. set to use with sqlite option`
* `sqlite option : save the log int sqlite. set to use with save option.`

### 4. Stop

There is no stop interface, then stop by 
```
Ctrl + C
```
or 
find the process id of the runnning process then kill such as 
```
$ ps -eaf | grep simpleleaf
$ kill xxxx
```
